# sentiment-analysis-with-naive-bayes
Using different classifiers to do sentiment analysis. Initial classifier used was Naive Bayes

In the first iteration I used, naive bayes classifier. The idea behind this classifier is the Bayes theorem.
The reason why it's called Naive is that Bayes theorem always assumes independence between the variables, 
however in this application it's rare that any two variables will not have any correlation between them.
